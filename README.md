# StreetByter

Practicing algorithms can be difficult and lonely, especially when you are on your own.

That's why we created StreetByter, a web application where users can compete against friends in real-time to solve coding problems.

Users of StreetByter race to be the first to solve all test specs for the selected problem, either through some old-fashioned dexterous coding skills or by playing dirty through the application of various "power-ups" (these include: clearing your opponent's code, freezing your opponent's editor, swapping code with your opponent, and more!).

Users can also practice on their own in classic mode if they so choose - be sure to check out the linked video for examples of real-time play!
