# :crossed_swords: StreetByter :crossed_swords:

Practicing algorithms can be difficult, especially when you are going it on your own.

That's why we created StreetByter, a web application where users can compete against friends in real-time to solve coding problems.

Users of StreetByter race to be the first to solve all test specs for the selected problem, either through some old-fashioned dexterous coding skills or by playing dirty through the application of various "power-ups" (these include [freezing your opponent's editor](https://github.com/codewar-pvp/codewar-pvp#freeze), [swapping code with your opponent](https://github.com/codewar-pvp/codewar-pvp#swap), and more!).

These power-ups add another dimension of strategy to StreetByter - since users are able to see an [obfuscated version of their opponent's code](https://github.com/codewar-pvp/codewar-pvp#obfuscated_code) while playing, power-ups can be leveraged at key points throughout the battle to aid (or impede!) either user.

Users can also practice on their own in classic mode if they so choose - be sure to check out the GIFS below or [our presentation video](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjFO5t0MLyQaidKGpGoRewg) for examples of real-time play!
